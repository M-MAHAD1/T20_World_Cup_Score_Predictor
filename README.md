project:
  name: "T20 World Cup Score Predictor"

overview: |
  This project predicts the final score of a T20 cricket match using machine learning. 
  Multiple regression models were tested and evaluated. Among them, the XGBRegressor 
  model achieved the best results and is used as the final model for predictions. 
  The application provides a web interface built using the Streamlit library for ease 
  of use and real-time prediction capability.

example:
  description: |
    In the Pakistan vs India T20 World Cup 2022 match at Melbourne Cricket Ground, 
    India scored 113 runs. The model predicted a total of 118 runs â€” showcasing its 
    high accuracy and real-time application.

how_to_run:
  steps:
    - Open the project folder in PyCharm or any Python IDE.
    - Open the file named `App.py`.
    - Ensure the model file `pipe.pkl` is available in the same directory.
    - Open the terminal in the IDE and run:
      command: "streamlit run App.py"
    - Before running, install required libraries:
      install_command: "pip install xgboost streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn"
